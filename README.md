# Project_Manager

What is a project?   
A project is a team of people working together to achieve a specific goal. 
This goal can be anything we can imagine, from developing a simple website to building a space exploration rocket. 

In order to facilitate the achievement of a major goal, the team divides it into smoller gols, usually called tasks.

What project management is :

The project management is the process of assigning tasks to team members, and working on well realisation of them.
However, this process is not linear, and can sometimes be very complicated and lead to many disturbances.   

To make task management easier, I developed this project, in fact this web application allows project managers to create tasks, then assign them to group members.   

After that, each member can start his task, and mark it as completed or stopped whenever he wants. 
When the task is completed, the member uploads it for testing.   
The administrator can then either mark the task as completed or request that it be resumed. In the latter case, a task is reassigned to its owner to review and add what was not done.  

Once the task is complete, the admin can have acces to some statistics very usfule concering the realisation of each task   
- The time it have taken to bea realised 
- The time wested time (defrence between the worked time and the whol time (from start to end, break counted))
